# Verification Fundamentals
The section primarily focuses on the fundamentals of the verification rate. This includes how one assesses and develops a verification plan. It is necessary to review a specification sheet to create effective test cases.


## Verification Plan: -
To implement a verification plan, send the stimulus to duty and verify the feature, which will enhance your understanding of how to read the verification plan.

## Directed Test Vs Constrained Random Test: -
The text explores the various types of testing methods available in our framework, specifically highlighting detected tests and constrained random tests. Among these, constrained random testing stands out as the primary strategy we will employ. This method, often referred to as constrained random verification language, utilizes randomness within specific constraints to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the testing process. By implementing this approach, we aim to achieve more comprehensive verification while navigating the complexities of the system under evaluation.

## Layered Testbench Architecture: -
We will explore the latest Finch architecture, gaining a comprehensive understanding of its design and functionality. Our approach will begin with an overview of the abstract architecture, allowing us to grasp the foundational concepts and overall structure. 

## Individual Components of Layered Testbench Architecture: -
After that, we will conduct a thorough examination of the various components that make up the system. Our focus will be on understanding the specific functions of each component and how they work together to enhance the overall performance of the system. In line with this, our agenda will include a detailed listing of the individual components that comprise a lock architecture system. This will help us gain a clearer perspective on the different classes we need to develop and how each element contributes to the system's efficiency and security.
